## 🇧🇷 Brazil

| Source          | Description                                 | Share of Electricity Mix | Avg. Monthly Generation (GWh) | Avg. Industrial Cost (BRL/MWh) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Hydropower**  | Large dams and river-based generation       | ~67%                      | ~30,600 GWh                   | ~250–300 BRL¹                   |
| **Wind**        | Onshore wind turbines                       | ~15%                      | ~6,830 GWh                    | ~180–250 BRL²                   |
| **Solar PV**    | Photovoltaic generation                     | ~7%                       | ~3,170 GWh                    | ~180–250 BRL²                   |
| **Biomass**     | Sugarcane bagasse and other bio waste       | ~6%                       | ~2,750 GWh                    | ~300–400 BRL²                   |
| **Biogas**      | Landfill/digester gas                       | <1%                       | <420 GWh                      | ~400–500 BRL²                   |

**Notes:**

1. Hydropower still dominates Brazil's mix (~67% in 2023), down from ~74% in 2018 due to solar/wind growth. Total yearly generation ~550 TWh. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/brazil-diversifies-clean-power-sources-away-hydro-2024-03-14))
2. Cost estimates reflect typical LCOE values from auctions and market analysis in Brazil.

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Wind**        | Onshore + offshore wind                      | ~31.5%                    | ~11,367 GWh                   | ~80–100 €¹                    |

| **Biomass**     | Forest/agricultural bioenergy                | ~6.5%                     | ~2,583 GWh                    | ~120–150 €¹                   |
| **Hydropower**  | Run-of-river and small-scale hydro           | ~4.7%                     | ~1,725 GWh                    | ~80–110 €¹                    |

**Notes:**

1. Industrial LCOE estimates based on Fraunhofer ISE, Eurostat, and energy market reports (2023–2024).
2. Germany's energy mix continues its shift away from fossil and nuclear toward renewables as part of the **Energiewende** policy.

## ⚡ Grid Reliability & Outages

### 🇧🇷 Brazil – Power Interruptions

- **Average outage duration (SAIDI):** ~624 minutes/year (~10.4 hours), for all consumers.
- **Outages/year (SAIFI):** ~5.2 interruptions annually (2023, ANEEL).
- **Industrial impact:** Particularly high in Northern and rural regions (up to 70+ hours/year).
- **Extreme events:** Floods and infrastructure failures can cause **days-long outages** (e.g., up to 30 days in parts of Rio Grande do Sul in 2024).

### 🇩🇪 Germany – Power Interruptions

- **Average outage duration (SAIDI):** ~13 minutes/year (BNetzA, 2023).
- **Outages/year (SAIFI):** ~0.24 interruptions/year.
- **Industrial impact:** Extremely low; most industrial facilities experience near-uninterrupted supply.
- **Short interruptions (<3 min):** Reported by ~50% of German firms, but rarely disruptive.

## ⚠️ Curtailment of Renewable Energy

**Curtailment** refers to the reduction of renewable generation (e.g. wind, solar) due to grid constraints or oversupply. It results in lost clean energy that cannot be used or transmitted.

| Feature                    | 🇧🇷 Brazil                                 | 🇩🇪 Germany                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Main cause                 | Grid congestion (esp. NE), hydro dispatch | Transmission bottlenecks (north → south)|
| Affected sources           | Mostly wind, solar                        | Wind (onshore/offshore), some solar     |
| Compensation for curtailment | No standardized payments; limited relief | Yes, legally mandated payments          |
| Curtailment rate (est.)    | ~1.5–3% of renewable generation           | ~1.8% of renewable generation (2023)    |
| Infrastructure bottleneck | Transmission line delays                  | North–South grid capacity                |

### 🇧🇷 Brazil

- Wind and solar are curtailed particularly in the **Northeast**, where generation exceeds local demand and transmission is delayed.
- Hydro plants with reservoirs often take dispatch priority.
- Lack of compensation discourages further private investment in some regions.

### 🇩🇪 Germany

- Curtailment mainly affects **onshore wind** in the North due to limited capacity to transfer energy to the industrial South.
- Operators are **compensated** for curtailed energy (*Entschädigungszahlungen*).
- Grid expansion projects (e.g., SuedLink) aim to reduce the issue long-term.

## 🔍 Summary

- **Brazil** still relies heavily on **hydropower** (~67%), but **wind** and **solar PV** have grown substantially since 2018, now contributing over **22%** combined.
- **Germany** leads in **wind and solar**, with wind accounting for nearly **1/3** of the electricity mix.
- **Biomass** and **biogas** play small but consistent roles in both countries.
- **Grid reliability:** Germany has **one of the most reliable grids globally** (~13 min/year outage), while Brazil’s system is **more vulnerable**, with outages averaging **10+ hours/year** and worsening in extreme weather conditions.
- **Curtailment:** Both countries lose some renewable generation due to transmission constraints; Germany has better compensation mechanisms.
- **Costs:** Generally **lower in Brazil**, but more **volatile and regionally inconsistent** compared to Germany.
