## 🇧🇷 Brazil

| Source          | Description                                 | Share of Electricity Mix | Avg. Monthly Generation (GWh) | Avg. Industrial Cost (BRL/MWh) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Hydropower**  | Large dams and river-based generation       | ~67%                      | ~30,600 GWh                   | ~250–300 BRL¹                   |
| **Wind**        | Onshore wind turbines                       | ~15%                      | ~6,830 GWh                    | ~180–250 BRL²                   |
| **Solar PV**    | Photovoltaic generation                     | ~7%                       | ~3,170 GWh                    | ~180–250 BRL²                   |
| **Biomass**     | Sugarcane bagasse and other bio waste       | ~6%                       | ~2,750 GWh                    | ~300–400 BRL²                   |
| **Biogas**      | Landfill/digester gas                       | <1%                       | <420 GWh                      | ~400–500 BRL²                   |

**Notes:**

1. Hydropower still dominates Brazil's mix (~67% in 2023), down from ~74% in 2018 due to solar/wind growth. Total yearly generation ~550 TWh. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/brazil-diversifies-clean-power-sources-away-hydro-2024-03-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. Cost estimates reflect typical LCOE values from auctions and market analysis in Brazil.

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Wind**        | Onshore + offshore wind                      | ~31.5%                    | ~11,367 GWh                   | ~80–100 €¹                    |
| **Solar PV**    | Photovoltaic solar generation                | ~13.8%                    | ~6,017 GWh                    | ~100–120 €¹                   |
| **Biomass**     | Forest/agricultural bioenergy                | ~6.5%                     | ~2,583 GWh                    | ~120–150 €¹                   |
| **Hydropower**  | Run-of-river and small-scale hydro           | ~4.7%                     | ~1,725 GWh                    | ~80–110 €¹                    |

**Notes:**

1. Industrial LCOE estimates based on Fraunhofer ISE, Eurostat, and energy market reports (2023–2024).
2. Germany's energy mix continues its shift away from fossil and nuclear toward renewables as part of the **Energiewende** policy.

## 🔍 Summary

- **Brazil** still relies heavily on **hydropower** (~67%), but **wind** and **solar PV** have grown substantially since 2018, now contributing over **22%** combined.
- **Germany** leads in **wind and solar**, with wind accounting for nearly **1/3** of the electricity mix.
- **Biomass** and **biogas** play small but consistent roles in both countries.
- Costs are generally **lower in Brazil** (due to natural resources and low-carbon legacy infrastructure) but **more volatile** due to transmission and regulation issues.
